01_globalmem

Description:
The demo would create a device file, you can use  "open, write, read, ioctl" to 
control the device.  

The advantage is to interact with a device resources in kernel space.


Some Instructions:

> make 
> insmod globalmem.ko

> echo "hello world" > /dev/globalmem
> cat /dev/globalmem

> ./write
> ./read

> rmmod globalmem

> make clean


TODO list:
1.refine read and write client, it's better to merge the two file into one
2.add llseek and ioctl function in client program
3.refine coding style in globamem.c, make it simple and clean
4.some error handling process needs to be optimized.
